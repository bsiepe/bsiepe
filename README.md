### Hi 👋
I am a Doctoral student in Psychological Methods. 
My research focuses on three areas: metascience of methodological research (particularly simulation studies), time series models for psychological time series, and applied experience sampling research. I’m interested in understanding how we can make methodological research more robust and transparent, and how we can better model intensive longitudinal data.

I maintain [openESM](https://openesmdata.org), an open-source database of openly available experience sampling data. You can find all code for openESM on its [project page](https://github.com/openesm-project).
