### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student in Psychological Methods with a background in Economics and Psychology. In my methodological work, I am interested in Time Series, Simulation Studies, and Networks. 
I like to apply these methods to learn more about how experience sampling and passive sensor data can help us better understand and predict mental disorders.
