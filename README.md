### Hi there 👋
I am a PhD student in Psychological Methods with a background in economics and psychology. In my methodological work, I am interested in time series, simulation studies, and open science. 
I like to apply these methods to learn more about how experience sampling and passive sensor data can help us better understand and predict mental disorders.

I maintain [openESM](https://openesmdata.org), an open-source database of openly available experience sampling data. You can find all code for openESM on its [project page](https://github.com/openesm-project).
