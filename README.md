### Hi there 👋
I am a PhD student in Psychological Methods with a background in Economics and Psychology. In my methodological work, I am interested in Time Series Analysis, Network Science, and Bayesian Statistics. I like to apply these methods to learn more about depression and ways in which passive sensor data can help us to better understand mental disorders.
